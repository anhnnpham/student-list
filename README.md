# student-list
### I use std::swap in utility header to perform the object swap (algorithm header prior to C++11).
User fills a list of students with their names, IDs and graduation dates.
#### User can choose in what order the list displays:
(1): by name, ascending

(2): by name, descending

(3): by ID, ascending

(4): by ID, descending

(5): by graduation year, ascending

(6): by graduation year, descending
