# student-list
User fills a list of students with their names, IDs and graduation dates.

### User can choose in what order the list displays:
(1): by name, ascending

(2): by name, descending

(3): by ID, ascending

(4): by ID, descending

(5): by graduation year, ascending

(6): by graduation year, descending

I use std::swap in <utility> to perform the object swap (<algorithm> prior to C++11).
